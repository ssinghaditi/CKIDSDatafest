# CKIDSDatafest Presentation
A project I worked on in collaboration with 3 other graduate students under a Sociology Professor. Her research focused on global inequality in maternal bereavement using country-specific survey datasets. 

- Performed exploratory analysis on over 400 semi-structured large datasets involving cleaning datasets, finding target variables, and appending select datasets by efficiently leveraging reusable code
- Generated quantitative insights about primary research question to augment qualitative observations and discussed further machine learning approaches

The presentation summarizes our key findings and includes snapshots of our code.
